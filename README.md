# Data Cleaning and Exploration: Hotels in Munnar, Kerala

This repository contains the code and analysis for data cleaning and exploration of the "Hotels in Munnar, Kerala" dataset. This project is part of the week-long event called "Imersão de Dados: Análise com IA" organized by Alura.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and is titled "Hotels in Munnar, Kerala (MakeMyTrip)." It provides valuable information about various hotels, including ratings, prices, and tax details in Munnar, Kerala.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to enhance my skills in data visualization using Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib. Through this exploration, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and practice effective data visualization techniques.

## Analysis and Visualization

The analysis includes data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the dataset. The visualization aspect of this project utilizes Seaborn and Matplotlib to create informative plots and charts that help in understanding the data better.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Alura team for organizing the "Imersão de Dados: Análise com IA" event. This initiative provides an excellent opportunity for individuals like me to learn and grow in the field of data analysis and artificial intelligence.
